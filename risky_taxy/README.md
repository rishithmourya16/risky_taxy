# Proactive Tax Fraud Detection Using Explainable AI

This repository provides the full implementation of a research study designed to detect fraudulent tax returns using explainable artificial intelligence. The system integrates a hybrid of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost), a deep neural network with an attention mechanism, and interpretability tools such as SHAP values and attention heatmaps.

The solution is designed with compliance, transparency, and scalability in mind—supporting IRS-aligned fraud detection with fully synthetic, privacy-respecting data.

## Key Features

- Dataset reflecting synthetic realistic tax filing and fraud behaviors
- A hybrid machine learning pipeline that combines tree-based models with deep learning
- Early fraud risk detection from partially completed tax returns
- Multi-stage fraud risk scoring engine with real-time updates
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on operational load
- Explainable scoring with SHAP-based,  confidence-aware decisions, and attention maps
- Persistent state tracking and prioritization of high-risk returns
- Modular and extensible for research, government, or auditing needs

## Model Evaluation

| Model             | Accuracy | Recall | Precision | F1 Score |
|------------------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Rule-based        | 0.78     | 0.39   | 0.72      | 0.50     |
| XGBoost (GBDT)    | 0.90     | 0.84   | 0.80      | 0.82     |
| Attention-based DNN | 0.89   | 0.80   | 0.82      | 0.81     |
| Hybrid Ensemble   | 0.92     | 0.88   | 0.83      | 0.85     |

The hybrid model consistently achieves the best fraud detection performance in terms of both precision and recall.

## Explainability

We use SHAP to generate global and local explanations for fraud predictions and complement this with attention heatmaps extracted from the neural network. These tools are designed to support transparency and decision justification for auditing purposes.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aalosbeh/tax-fraud-xai.git
cd tax-fraud-xai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python data/generate_data.py               # Step 1: Generate dataset (Ensure your dataset is located at: `sample_data/synthetic_tax_data.csv`)
python models/train_xgboost.py             # Step 2: Train XGBoost model
python models/train_dnn.py                 # Step 3: Train DNN with attention
python models/train_hybrid.py              # Step 4: Train meta-learner
python analysis/shap_analysis.py           # Step 5: Run SHAP explainability
python analysis/attention_heatmap.py       # Step 6: Generate heatmaps
```

## How to Run (Using PyCharm)

### Step 1: Clone and Set Up Environment

1. Open PyCharm and clone the repository or unzip it locally.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Create a virtual environment via PyCharm (Python ≥ 3.8).
4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Generate Dataset

```bash
python data/generate_data.py
```

This will generate `synthetic_tax_fraud_dataset.csv` in the `/data` folder.

### Step 3: Train Models

```bash
python models/train_xgboost.py         # Train XGBoost
python models/train_dnn.py            # Train DNN with attention
python models/train_hybrid.py         # Combine models with logistic regression
```

### Step 4: Run Explainability Analysis

```bash
python analysis/shap_analysis.py       # SHAP value plots
python analysis/attention_heatmap.py   # Attention weight heatmaps
```

### Step 5: Run Proactive Risk Framework
**Run the System Pipeline**

   Open `pipeline_core.py` and run the script:
   - This processes all returns
   - Computes stage-wise scores
   - Exports state logs and scores to `results/sample_run_output.json`
   - 
```bash
python core/state_manager.py
python core/prioritization.py #View Risk Matrix (Optional)
python core/adaptive_thresholds.py
```
## Output Examples

- `/figures`: Prioritization heatmap, SHAP summary, attention maps
- `results/states.json`: Tracked fraud risk and recommendation per return

  ## Risk Score Formula

Each return's risk score is calculated using:
\[
S_c = lpha \cdot P_f + (1 - lpha) \cdot rac{R_i}{R_{max}}
\]

Where:
- \( P_f \): Predicted fraud probability (0-1)
- \( R_i \): Estimated revenue impact
- \( R_{max} \): Maximum observed impact across all returns
- \(lpha \): Default 0.7 (adjustable)

Where:
- \( P_f \): Predicted fraud probability (0-1)
- \( R_i \): Estimated revenue impact
- \( R_{max} \): Maximum observed impact across all returns
- \( lpha \): Default 0.7 (adjustable)

## Sample Output

Each processed tax return will be scored with fields like:

```json
{
  "return_id": "TX2023_001",
  "stage": "post-processing",
  "fraud_prob": 0.88,
  "revenue_impact": 102350,
  "composite_score": 0.834,
  "recommended_action": "Investigate Immediately"
}
```
## Run a Case Study

```bash
cd case_studies/2023_audit/
python process.py
```

## Results

| Stage            | Detection Rate | Confidence | Data Source               |
|------------------|----------------|------------|----------------------------|
| Pre-filing       | 38%            | ±25%       | Historical + Third-party   |
| Initial Filing   | 58%            | ±15%       | Partial filing data        |
| Post-processing  | 88%            | ±5%        | Full documentation         |

### Operational Impact
- 2.1× faster fraud pattern detection
- 38% reduction in manual audit hours
- 17% increase in recovered tax discrepancies
  
## Legal Context and Ethics

This tool uses only synthetically generated data (NOT REAL) that statistically mimics IRS filing patterns. It references core U.S. tax fraud statutes, including:
- [26 U.S.C. §7201 - Tax evasion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7201)
- [26 U.S.C. §7206 - Fraudulent returns](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7206)
